# Conjunction-Analysis

Overview:
This analysis and visualization of space conjunction data, which pertains to instances where Resident Space Objects (RSOs) in Earth's orbit come dangerously close to one another. With the growing number of RSOs in orbit, the frequency of predicted conjunctions has increased significantly, presenting a pressing challenge for satellite operators and space agencies.

Key Features:

Single-Day Conjunction Analytics:

Analyzes a single day's worth of conjunction data to provide high-level insights into the state of space conjunctions for that specific day. This includes the total number of conjunctions among active satellites, time distribution of conjunctions, and risk assessments.
Individual Satellite and Constellation Analysis:

Enables a closer look at the conjunction data of individual satellites or entire satellite constellations. This analysis provides detailed information about each conjunction, risk assessments, and historical trends.

Five-Day Data Evolution:

 dataset spanning approximately five days to track how conjunction scenarios evolve over time. This analysis offers a dynamic perspective on collision risks, helping satellite operators make informed decisions.
 

Goals:
This repository aims to address the challenges posed by the increasing number of RSOs and conjunction scenarios in Earth's orbit. By providing analytics and visualizations in an understandable format, it empowers satellite operators, space agencies, and space enthusiasts to make well-informed decisions regarding satellite operations and collision avoidance
