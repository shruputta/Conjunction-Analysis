•	DILUTION may represent a measure of how diluted or dispersed the risk of collision is during the conjunction, indicating the level of risk or severity.




the data cleaning steps as if you're presenting them:
1. Consistent Time Format: Make sure all times in the "TCA" column follow the same "hh:mm.ss" format. Fix any variations.
2. Missing Data Handling: Decide what to do with missing info in important columns. You can either fill in defaults or remove rows with missing data.
3. Special Characters and Encoding: Check for weird characters in text data. Ensure all text is clean and readable.
4. Object Names Matching: Confirm that object names in "OBJECT_NAME_1" and "OBJECT_NAME_2" match when they're the same.
5. Outlier Detection: Identify and handle extreme values in columns like "TCA_RANGE," "TCA_RELATIVE_SPEED," "MAX_PROB," and "DILUTION."
6. Data Type Consistency: Ensure numbers are recognized as numbers and are in the same format (e.g., using a dot for decimals).
7. Validate Numerical Values: Verify that numbers like "MAX_PROB" and "DILUTION" are within the expected range, typically between 0 and 1.


steps to calculate a threshold value for "active" satellites based on the "DSE" values using Python:
1.	Load Your Data: Load your dataset into Python using libraries like Pandas.
2.	Understand Your Data: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the "DSE" values. This can involve calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations.
3.	Define Your Criteria: Determine what you consider "active" based on the "DSE" values. This can be based on your analysis goals, domain knowledge, or stakeholder input.
4.	Choose a Statistical Approach: Select a statistical method to calculate the threshold. Common approaches include percentiles, standard deviations, or domain-specific standards.
5.	Calculate the Threshold: Calculate the threshold value based on the selected method (e.g., using the 90th percentile, which represents the top 10% of the data).
6.	Apply the Threshold: Create a new column in your dataset that categorizes each satellite as "Active" or "Inactive" based on the calculated threshold.
7.	Review and Adjust: Review the results and adjust the threshold as needed to align with your analysis goals and data characteristics.

import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Load Your Data
data = pd.read_csv(sort_minRange.csv')

# Step 2: Understand Your Data
# Get summary statistics
summary_stats = data['DSE_1'].describe()

# Create a histogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
data['DSE_1'].plot.hist()
plt.xlabel('DSE Values')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Histogram of DSE Values')
plt.show()


# Step 3: Define Your Criteria
# Define what makes a satellite "active" based on domain knowledge and analysis goals

# Step 4: Choose a Statistical Approach
# Calculate the threshold as the 90th percentile (adjust as needed)
threshold = data['DSE_1'].quantile(0.90)

# Step 5: Calculate the Threshold
# Set the threshold value to 0.09
# threshold = 0.09

# Step 6: Apply the Threshold
# Create a new column for satellite 1's status
data['SatelliteStatus_1'] = data['DSE_1'].apply(lambda x: 'Active' if x > threshold else 'Inactive')

Total Number of Conjunctions for the Day:
•	We start by counting the total number of conjunction scenarios for the given day.

Number of Conjunctions Among Active Satellites:
•	Next, we filter the dataset to include only rows where the 'SatelliteStatus' is 'Active' and count the number of conjunctions among active satellites.

Number of Conjunctions Among Inactive Satellites:
•	Similarly, we filter for 'Inactive' satellites and count the number of conjunctions.

Maximum TCA Range:
•	We find the maximum value in the 'TCA_RANGE' column, which represents the closest approach distance among all conjunction scenarios.

Average Maximum Probability (MAX_PROB) of Conjunctions:
•	We calculate the average of the 'MAX_PROB' values, representing the average probability of a conjunction occurring.

Average DILUTION for Conjunctions:
•	Lastly, we calculate the average 'DILUTION' values to understand the average level of dilution for conjunction scenarios.

3: Conjunction Analytics Summary 
Now, let's summarize these analytics in a report:
•	Total Conjunctions: 67k
•	Active Satellite1 Conjunctions: 6k
•	Inactive Satellite` Conjunctions: 61k
•	Active Satellite2 Conjunctions: 6k
•	Inactive Satellite2 Conjunctions:61k
•	MAX_PROB: (on a scale of 0 to 1) 0.04
•	AverageRelative speed: 11.34
This report provides a quick overview of the daily conjunction scenarios, distinguishing between active and inactive satellites and highlighting key statistics.

4 Satellite Conjunction Data Dashboard 
Moving on to representing satellite conjunction data for decision-making by satellite operators.
Interactive Dashboard:
•	We have created an interactive dashboard that empowers operators to select a specific satellite or constellation.
•	This dashboard provides a summary of conjunction scenarios, visualizations, historical trends, and risk assessment metrics.

Risk Assessment Model:
•	Operators can now quantify the level of risk for each conjunction scenario, taking factors like TCA_RANGE, MAX_PROB, and DILUTION into account.
